# Melvor Editor

Most Melvor Idle save editors I have seen simply loaded your save file and gave you a text area to edit the JSON directly. The goal of this project is to provide a better user experience through a ui editor for save files.

This is an ongoing labor of love. Pull requests and updates are always welcome.
